## What It Does

Agent Router integrates with **GitHub Copilot Chat** as a native `@router` chat participant. It scores the complexity of your prompt (0–100) and automatically routes it to the most appropriate Copilot model — so you use powerful premium models only when they're actually needed.

```
@router <your prompt>
      │
      ▼
  Complexity Score (0–100)
  via keyword heuristics
      │
      ├─ Score ≤ threshold → 🟢 Free model      (gpt-5-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-4.1)
      └─ Score >  threshold → 🔴 Premium model  (claude-sonnet-4.6, gemini-3-pro, gpt-5.3-codex…)
      │
      ▼
  Full agentic loop with 30 tools (file edits, terminal, search, git…)
  Response streamed back into Copilot Chat
```

## Installation

### Option A — From `.vsix` File (Manual)

1. Download the latest `.vsix` from [Releases](https://github.com/adnnoky/github-copilot-agent-router/releases)
2. Open VS Code → **Extensions** sidebar (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
3. Click the `···` menu (top-right) → **Install from VSIX…**
4. Select the downloaded file and reload VS Code

### Option B — VS Code Marketplace

Search for **"Agent Router"** in the Extensions panel, or:

```
ext install local.agent-router-extension
```

### Prerequisites

- VS Code `^1.95.0`
- [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) extension installed & active
- Active GitHub Copilot subscription (for premium model access)

---

## Usage

Open **Copilot Chat** (`Ctrl+Alt+I` / `⌘⌥I`) and type:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `@router <prompt>` | Score, route and answer your prompt |
| `@router /help` or `@router /?` | Show the full help page |
| `@router /explain <prompt>` | Show routing decision (score, tier, model) — no LLM call |
| `@router /boost <prompt>` | Expand a short prompt into a detailed one using chat history for context |
| `@router /<model> <prompt>` | Pin a specific model via the autocomplete dropdown, bypassing auto-routing. (e.g., `@router /gpt-4o`) |
| `@router --model <name> <prompt>` | Pin a specific model manually, bypassing auto-routing |

### Examples

```
@router how do I reverse a string in Python?
→ 🟢 Free tier (gpt-4o) — low complexity

@router design a distributed OAuth2 auth system with Kubernetes and Redis caching
→ 🔴 Premium tier (claude-3.5-sonnet) — high complexity

@router /claude-sonnet-4.6 refactor my auth module
→ 📌 Pinned model (claude-sonnet-4.6)

@router /claude-sonnet-4.6 /boost implement missing methods
→ 📌 Pinned model (claude-sonnet-4.6), expands prompt with history, then generates answer

@router /explain refactor my authentication module for microservices
→ Shows score breakdown without making any model call

@router /help
→ Shows full help, available models, and tool list
```

## Chat Memory

Starting with v1.8.0, **all** model requests — routing, agentic tool loops, simple responses, and `/boost` prompt expansion — automatically include the preceding turns of your current Copilot Chat session as context. This lets the model reference earlier questions and answers in the same conversation without you repeating yourself.

**Context-length note:** Each prior turn adds tokens to the request. Very long conversations may approach a model's context window limit. If you notice slower responses or truncated answers, start a new chat session to reset the history.

**Privacy note:** Conversation history is passed to the selected Copilot model (the same model that already handles your prompt). No history is stored or sent anywhere outside of the active Copilot session.

## Premium Quota & Dashboard 📊

Agent Router makes a best-effort attempt to track your **Premium Request limits** using an internal/undocumented GitHub Copilot endpoint. This is **not** an official, supported public API, so it may change, become unavailable, or be inaccessible for some accounts without notice.

- **Status Bar Indicator**: View your remaining premium request count and dynamic capacity percentage conveniently in the VS Code status bar when quota data is available.
- **Copilot Usage Dashboard**: Click the status bar or run `Agent Router: Show Premium Stats` to open the interactive dashboard for detailed metrics, historical session logs, and exact quota reset timelines when available.
- **Expected failure modes**: Depending on your account, Copilot plan, authentication state, token scopes, GitHub backend changes, rate limits, or response-format changes, premium-usage data may be missing, partial, stale, or fail to load entirely.
- **Fallback behavior**: If quota data cannot be retrieved, Agent Router will continue to route prompts and provide chat/agent functionality as normal; only the premium-usage indicator/dashboard may be degraded or unavailable.

### Configuration

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agentRouter.freeThreshold` | `number` | `90` | Complexity score threshold (0-100). Scores ≤ this go to a free model. |
| `agentRouter.agentMode` | `boolean` | `true` | Enable/disable agentic tool access (file editing, terminal, etc). |
| `agentRouter.hybridAgentMode` | `boolean` | `true` | When using a premium model, automatically switch to a free model for intermediate agent tool calls to save premium request quota. |
| `agentRouter.allowGitCommands` | `boolean` | `false` | (Beta) Allow the agent to automatically commit and push changes. |

Open **Settings** (`Ctrl+,`) and search `agentRouter` to adjust.

## 🛠️ How it matches models

### Free Model Families

`gpt-4o`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-4.1`

### Premium Model Families

All other available Copilot models (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4.6`, `gemini-3-pro`, `gpt-5.3-codex`) are treated as **premium**.

## Complexity Scoring

Prompts are scored 0–100 using fast non-blocking keyword heuristics:

| Factor | Points | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Base score | +10 | All prompts |
| Length bonus | +25 | Long prompts |
| Multi-step structure | +8 | 4+ lines |
| Dense technical syntax | +7 | Code-heavy content |
| Architecture / Distributed | +20 | kubernetes, microservices, load balancing… |
| Security / Auth / Encryption | +20 | OAuth2, JWT, TLS, cryptography… |
| ML / Neural Networks | +18 | transformers, NLP, embeddings… |
| Performance / Optimization | +15 | caching, indexing, profiling… |
| Refactoring / Migration | +12 | legacy, upgrade, deprecation… |
| Deep Debugging / Root-cause | +10 | memory leak, deadlock, race condition… |

## Agentic Tools (30 tools)

When `agentRouter.agentMode` is `true`, `@router` can call these tools during the response:

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| **File** | `readFile`, `writeFile`, `editFile`, `deleteFile`, `renameFile`, `copyFile`, `createDirectory`, `readFileLines`, `findAndReplace` |
| **Search** | `searchFiles`, `listDirectory` |
| **Code** | `getSymbols`, `getProblems`, `showDiff` |
| **Editor** | `openFile`, `getSelectedText`, `insertSnippet`, `listOpenEditors` |
| **Terminal** | `runCommand`, `runTests`, `getTerminalOutput`, `openTerminal` |
| **Git** | `getGitStatus` |
| **VS Code** | `getWorkspaceInfo`, `getExtensionSettings`, `getExtensionList`, `showNotification` |
| **Clipboard** | `clipboardRead`, `clipboardWrite` |
| **Network** | `fetchUrl` |

### Terminal Execution: Headless vs Visible

The agent possesses two distinct tools for running terminal commands:

1. **Headless Execution (`runCommand`)**: By default, when you ask the agent to run scripts, build apps, or fix errors, the agent runs the command headlessly in the background. **This is highly recommended** because it forces the agent to *wait* for the command to finish, read the resulting `stdout`/`stderr`, and intelligently fix any errors if it fails. You can view the logs for these headless commands by expanding the tool calls in the Chat panel.
2. **Visible Execution (`openTerminal`)**: You can explicitly ask the agent to "run this in a visible terminal panel" (or specify a tab name like "wsl" or "powershell"). The agent will open a VS Code terminal and paste the command. **Warning:** This is a blind, fire-and-forget action. The agent cannot see the output and cannot wait for it to finish. Use this only for infinite-running dev servers (e.g., `npm run dev`) or when you just want to take over manually.
